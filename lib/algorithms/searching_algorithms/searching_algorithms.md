 - Search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem. Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values. 
  
 - The appropriate search algorithm to use often depends on the data structure being searched, and may also include prior knowledge about the data. Search algorithms can be made faster or more efficient by specially constructed database structures, such as search trees, hash maps, and database indexes.

- **Search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching into three types**:
    1. **Linear search algorithm** -> checks every record for the one associated wit a target key / value in a linear fashion.
    2. **Binary search algorithm** -> aka half-interval, finds the position(index) of a target value within a **sorted** List. It does this by comparing the target value to the middle element of the list, if they are not equal the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found and its position / index is returned, if not found -1 is returned.
    3. **Hashing** -> directly maps key /values to records based on hash function.
