heap sort it is similar to selection sort but its worse time complexity is O(n log n) which is better than O(n^2) time complexity for selection sort. You ***first heapify*** the list, then you ***swap the first element*** at index 0 with the last element at index n - 1(where n is the current heap size). After swap, the last element of the list is in the correct spot but invalidates the heap. Thus the ***second step is to sift the root element down*** until it land in its correct position excluding then last element of the list from the heap since you no longer consider it as part of the heap but of the sorted list. Then you repeat the process of swapping and sifting down incrementing the number of elements to be excluded by 1 each time you do swap + sifting down (since those elements will have already been sorted) until you reach a heap of size 1, in which the list will be fully sorted.
