#### Definition:
- insertion sort insertion sort builds a sorted sublist from left to right. It iterates through each element in the unsorted section, comparing it with elements in the sorted sublist from right to left to find its correct insertion point. If necessary, it shifts existing sorted elements to make space before inserting the current element at its rightful position, repeating this process for each element until the entire list is sorted.[check geeksforgeeks for a visual illustration](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/).
