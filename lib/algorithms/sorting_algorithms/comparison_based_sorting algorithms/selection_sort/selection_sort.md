#### Definition:
- Selection sorting starts from the leftmost unsorted element in the unsorted list and iterates through the unsorted elements and selects the smallest element in the rightmost part of the unsorted list and swaps it with that leftmost unsorted element.This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.[check geeksforgeeks for a visual illustration](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/).
