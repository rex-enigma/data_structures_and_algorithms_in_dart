- Sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a **list** in a specific order. The most frequently used order are, ***numerical order*** and ***lexicographical order*** which can be either ascending(a-z,0-9) or descending(z-a,9-0) order.

#### List of sorting algorithms:
**A. Comparison based sorting algorithms:**
   1. bubble sort
   2. insertion sort
   3. selection sort
   4. merge sort
   5. quick sort
**B. Non_comparison based sorting algorithms:**
   1. radix sort
   2. counting sort
   3. bucket sort
