- A graph is a non-linear abstract data type consisting of a collection of vertices / nodes and edges / arcs. Edges are used to connect any two vertices in the graph. The graph is denoted by **G(V,E)**.

#### Graph terminologies:
1. **vertex** -> a fundamental unit of a graph, representing an entity. Vertices hold data associated with them.
2. **Edge** -> is a connection between two vertices. An edge can be ***directed***(indicating which direction the relationship flows) or ***undirected***( indicating that the relationship is bi-directional).An edge can also be ***weighted***( meaning an edge can have a ***weight*** value which is used to represent a certain quantifiable relationship btn the vertices it connects) or ***unweighted***(meaning an edge can lack weight value indicating that their is no 'cost' associated btn the vertices it connects).
3. **Weight** -> a value associated with an edge, indicating the 'cost' btn the connected vertices. Weighted graphs have weights assigned to their edges, while unweighted graphs do not.
4. **Adjacency** -> two vertices are adjacent if there an edge connecting them.
5. **Degree** -> The degree of a node is the number of edges incident to that node. In directed graphs, there are two degrees for each node: in-degree (number of incoming edges) and out-degree (number of outgoing edges).
6. **Path** -> A sequence of vertices connected by edges.
7. **Cycle** -> A path that starts and ends at the same vertex, without visiting any other vertex more than once(except for the start and end vertex)
