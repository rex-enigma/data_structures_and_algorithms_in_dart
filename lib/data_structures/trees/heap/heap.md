Heap a.k.a binary heap, is a specialized tree based data structure that satisfies the heap property, ensuring that a value of a parent node is always greater that or equal to(in a max **heap**) or less that or equal to(in a min **heap**) the value of its children. A heap is a **complete binary tree**( meaning all levels are fully filled, except possibly the last one, which is filled from left to right) that can be implemented using a **list**. It can be used to implement *priority queue*. [you can look at it in both tree representation or list representation, check wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)#/media/File:Max-Heap-new.svg). This heap is different from **memory heap** since memory heap is diff concept.
