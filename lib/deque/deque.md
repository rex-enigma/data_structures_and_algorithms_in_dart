Double-ended queue aka deque is an abstract data typed that allows elements/values to be inserted and removed on both sides ( front and back )

#### deque ADT can be implemented using:
1. list(normal array data structure).
2. doubly linked list data structure.
3. singly linked list data structure.



#### common operation are:
1. **enqueue** -> insert an element at the front or back of the deque. Return true when operation is successful.
2. **dequeue** -> remove and return the element at the front or back of the deque.
3. **peek** -> return an element at the front or back of the deque without removing it.

**Other Info:** Dart queues are actually double ended queues (deques), which means they can be accessed equally from either end, and can there for be used to implement both stack and queue behaviour.
