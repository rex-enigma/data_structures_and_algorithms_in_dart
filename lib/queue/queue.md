Queue used <b>FIFO</b>, first-in first-out ordering, meaning the first element that was added will always be the first to be removed.

Queues are handy when you need to maintain the order of your elements to process later.

Queue only cares about removal at the front and insertion at the back, you don't need to know what the contents are in between.

Queue can be implemented using:
1. list(normal array data structure).
2. doubly linked list.
3. Ring buffer. **
4. Two stacks.


#### common operation are:
1. enqueue -> insert an element at the back of the queue. Return true when operation is successful.
2. dequeue -> remove and return the element at the front of the queue.
3. isEmpty -> check if the queue is empty.
4. peek -> return a reference of the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
