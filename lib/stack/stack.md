A stack is a **LIFO**, last-in-first-out, data structure.

Common operation are push and pop method which have O(1) time complexity.

A stack can be implemented with a list(array) or a linked list, here we use list to implement it.

#### common operation are:
1. **push** -> adds element on top of the stack
2. **pop** -> removes element on top of the stack
3. **peek** -> returns a reference of the element on top of the stack without removing it.


##### applications of stack 
 1. Stacks are crucial to problems that search trees and graphs. eg backtracking.
 2. function call management.
 3. undo mechanism in software.
 4. browser history.

##### key points
1. A stack is a **LIFO**, last-in first-out data structure.
2. push,pop and peak are constant time operations
