A stack is a LIFO, last-in-first-out, data structure.

Common operation are push and pop method which have O(1) time complexity.

A stack can be implemented with a list(array) or a linked list, here we use list to implement it.


##### applications of stack 
 Stacks are crucial to problems that search trees and graphs.
