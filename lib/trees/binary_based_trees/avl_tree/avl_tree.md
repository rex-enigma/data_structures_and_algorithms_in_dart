AVL tree a.k.a **balanced binary search tree**, is a self-balancing binary search tree that guarantees a logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) for *search*, *insertion*,and *deletion* operations. Its always balanced(**perfectly balanced** or **good enough balanced**[balanced], check *trees.md file* for these illustrations).


#### common operation are:
1. **fast lookup / search / contains** -> 
2. **insert** -> 
   
3. **remove / delete** ->

4. **traversal** -> depthFirst(inOrder, postOrder, preOrder), except levelFirst/breathFirst traversal,are already implemented in the BinaryNode(check in binary_tree.dart file) in which AVL tree can use for node traversal. (you can also implement levelFirst/breathFirst traversal directly in BinaryNode if you want to add that functionality in AVL tree {port it from TreeNode in general_tree.dart file}).
