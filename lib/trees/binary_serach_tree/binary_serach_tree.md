 Binary search tree a.k.a **BST**, **ordered / sorted binary tree**, is a specialized binary tree data structure that **effectively organizes and maintains sorted data**. The left child is smaller and right child is greater than the parent node.  It can be **unbalanced**( **unbalanced**: is a kind of binary tree where the depth of the two subtrees of any node can differ significantly.)
 
 Binary search tree data structure facilitates **fast lookup / search**, **insert** and **removal**operations with average case time complexity of O(log n), and worse case time complexity of O(n)


 #### A binary search tree imposes two rules:
 1. The value of the **left child** must be less than the value of its parent.
 2. The value of the **right** must be greater the value of its parent.
 3.  Binary search tree cannot contain similar values on any two different nodes in tree.

 <!-- #### Traversal algorithms(Types of depth-first traversal):
 pre-order, post-order and in-order traversal algorithms are best described by a tree image check [visual representation of the traversal algorithms in Baeldung website](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/depth-first-traversal-methods). -->
