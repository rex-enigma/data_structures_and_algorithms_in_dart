Binary tree is a tree data structure where each node has at MOST two children, often referred to as **left** and **right** children. It can be **unbalanced**.

Binary trees serve as the basis for many tree structures and algorithms.

#### Traversal algorithms(Types of depth-first traversal);
1. pre-order traversal -> 
2. in-order traversal -> visits the nodes of a binary tree in the following order, starting from the root node.
  a. if the current node has a left child, recursively visit this child first.
  b. 

#### common operation are:
1. **pre-order traversal** -> action → left → right, 
2. **in-order traversal** -> left → action → right, 
3. **post-order traversal** -> left → right → action
   

##### applications of trees:


##### key points:
1. all the first 3 traversal algorithm have both time and space complexity of 0(n).
