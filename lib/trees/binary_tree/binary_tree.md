Binary tree is a tree data structure where each node has at MOST two children, often referred to as **left** and **right** children. It can be **unbalanced**.

Binary trees serve as the basis for many tree structures and algorithms.

#### Traversal algorithms(Types of depth-first traversal);
 pre-order, post-order and in-order traversal algorithms are best described by a tree image check [visual representation of the traversal algorithms in Baeldung website](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/depth-first-traversal-methods).

#### common operation are:
1. **pre-order traversal** -> action → left → right. 
2. **in-order traversal** -> left → action → right. 
3. **post-order traversal** -> left → right → action.
   

##### applications of trees:


##### key points:
1. all the first 3 traversal algorithm have both time and space complexity of 0(n).
